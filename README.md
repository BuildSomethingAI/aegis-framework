# Welcome to Aegis

> An AI-powered framework for managing complex software projects.

## What is Aegis?

Aegis is a powerful framework that combines AI capabilities with structured project management to help teams build better software. It provides:

- 🤖 AI-assisted project planning and execution
- 📋 Structured task management
- 🧠 Intelligent memory system
- 🔄 State tracking and validation
- 📝 Comprehensive documentation

## Collaborative Philosophy

Aegis is built on a collaborative philosophy where humans and AI work together with a shared understanding of principles and practices. This is reflected in our documentation approach:

- **Best Practices Documents**: Serve a dual purpose - they guide Aegis's behavior and provide reference for human collaboration
- **Shared Understanding**: The framework creates an environment where humans and AI operate from the same playbook
- **Transparent Operation**: Documentation explains not just what to do, but why and how Aegis approaches different aspects of project management

For more details on this collaborative approach, see [Understanding Best Practices in the Aegis Framework](user-guide/best-practices-purpose.md).
