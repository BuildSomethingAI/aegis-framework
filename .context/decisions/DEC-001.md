## Context
As part of TASK-017 "Implement Command Implementation Fail-Safes," we needed to create robust mechanisms to ensure complete and correct implementation of framework commands by the language model. The initial plan considered creating a new verification directory structure, but this raised concerns about adding unnecessary complexity to the framework.

## Decision
We decided to implement command fail-safe mechanisms within the existing framework structure rather than creating new directories. Specifically:

1. Enhanced the `validation.yaml` file with detailed command validation patterns for all core commands
2. Updated the `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file with comprehensive command implementation checklists
3. Added detailed implementation guides to command YAML files, starting with `save.yaml`

This approach leverages the existing framework structure while providing robust fail-safe mechanisms for command implementation.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Maintains a clean, streamlined framework structure without unnecessary directories
- Centralizes validation patterns in a single file, making them easier to maintain
- Provides clear, detailed implementation guides for each command
- Ensures consistent and complete execution of all framework commands
- Reduces the likelihood of incomplete command implementations

### Negative
- May require more careful organization of the validation.yaml file as it grows
- Could potentially make the AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md file longer and more complex

## Implementation Details
The implementation includes:

1. **Command Validation Patterns** in `validation.yaml`:
   - Pre-execution validation steps
   - Execution validation steps
   - Post-execution validation steps
   - Completion validation steps

2. **Command Implementation Checklists** in `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md`:
   - Detailed checklists for each command
   - Error prevention instructions
   - Recovery procedures

3. **Command Implementation Guides** in command YAML files:
   - Execution flowcharts
   - Step-by-step implementation examples
   - Error prevention strategies
   - Recovery procedures

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Create a new verification directory**: This would have added a new directory structure specifically for command validation, but was rejected to avoid unnecessary complexity.

2. **Use separate files for each command's validation**: This would have created multiple validation files, but was rejected in favor of centralizing validation patterns.

3. **Rely solely on AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md**: This would have placed all validation in the instructions file, but was rejected as it would make the file too complex and difficult to maintain.
