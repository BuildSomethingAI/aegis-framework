## Context
As part of TASK-017 "Implement Command Implementation Fail-Safes," we needed to create command templates with required components to ensure complete and correct implementation of framework commands. We had to decide how to implement these templates in a way that would be consistent with our previous decision (DEC-001) to leverage the existing framework structure.

## Decision
We decided to implement command templates directly within the existing operation YAML files rather than creating separate template files. Specifically:

1. Enhanced each core command YAML file (task.yaml, start.yaml, status.yaml, context.yaml, reconcile.yaml) with a `command_template` section
2. Defined required components for each execution phase (pre-execution, execution, post-execution, error handling)
3. Included validation rules and implementation instructions for each component
4. Added comprehensive implementation examples for each command

This approach maintains the principle of leveraging existing structures while providing detailed templates for command implementation.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Keeps all command-related information in a single file, making it easier to understand and maintain
- Avoids creating additional files or directories, maintaining a clean framework structure
- Provides clear, detailed guidance for implementing each command
- Ensures consistent structure across all command implementations
- Reduces the risk of incomplete or incorrect implementations

### Negative
- Makes operation YAML files longer and potentially more complex
- May require more careful organization of the files as they grow
- Could make it harder to find specific information within the files

## Implementation Details
The implementation includes:

1. **Command Template Structure** in each operation YAML file:
   - Name, description, and version
   - Required components for each execution phase
   - Validation rules for each component
   - Implementation instructions for each component
   - Comprehensive implementation examples

2. **Execution Phases** with required components:
   - Pre-execution: Validation and context loading
   - Execution: Core command functionality
   - Post-execution: Verification and reporting
   - Error handling: Error detection and resolution

3. **Component Definition** for each required component:
   - Description of the component's purpose
   - Validation rules for the component
   - Step-by-step implementation instructions

4. **Implementation Examples** showing:
   - How to implement each command correctly
   - How to handle common scenarios
   - How to validate and verify the implementation
   - How to handle errors and edge cases

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Create separate template files**: This would have created a new set of files specifically for command templates, but was rejected to avoid unnecessary complexity and maintain the principle of leveraging existing structures.

2. **Add templates to AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md**: This would have placed all templates in the instructions file, but was rejected as it would make the file too complex and difficult to maintain.

3. **Create a new templates directory**: This would have added a new directory structure for command templates, but was rejected to avoid unnecessary complexity and maintain a clean framework structure.
